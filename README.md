# MRP Sticker

## Overview
Developed a web application for generating Maximum Retail Price (MRP) stickers to enhance operational efficiency within the organization. The application significantly improved the speed and accuracy of product labeling. Users can create, customize, and print stickers with essential product information, including:

1. **Category**: The type of product (e.g., electronics, clothing, groceries) to facilitate easy identification and sorting.
2. **Model**: The specific model number or name of the product, ensuring accurate representation and differentiation.
3. **Content**: A brief description of the product, providing customers with relevant information.
4. **MRP (Maximum Retail Price)**: The price at which the product is sold to consumers, ensuring compliance with pricing regulations.
5. **MFD (Manufacturing Date)**: The date the product was manufactured, crucial for tracking product freshness and shelf life.
6. **MFD_AT (Manufacturing Address)**: The address of the manufacturing facility, important for compliance and traceability purposes.
7. **Image Path**: The file path for the primary product image to enhance visual appeal and recognition on the sticker.
8. **Image Path 1**: The file path for an additional image (if applicable), allowing for supplementary visual information, such as packaging or usage examples.

## How I Developed the Application
**Utilized the power of Python to write the code, leveraged the ReportLab library to create MRP sticker diagrams in PDF format, employed the Monstera font for a professional appearance, performed calculations to align the text, and used the Flask framework to bring my creativity to life on the web.**

## Benefits to the Company
1. **Increased Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined the process of generating MRP stickers, reducing the time required for labeling products and enhancing overall productivity.
2. **Improved Accuracy**: Minimized manual entry errors by automating the sticker generation process, leading to more accurate product information and compliance with regulatory standards.
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Provided a user-friendly interface that simplified the sticker creation process for employees, increasing adoption rates and satisfaction among users.
4. **Cost Savings**: Reduced printing costs by optimizing the design and format of the stickers, leading to better resource management.
5. **Professional Branding**: Utilized the Monstera font and well-designed stickers to enhance the company's branding and presentation, contributing to a more professional image in the market.
6. **Scalability**: Established a framework that allows for easy updates and scalability, accommodating future growth and changes in product lines.

## Challenges Faced
- The organization had many similar MRP stickers that did not have significant differences.
  - **Solution**: Instead of creating unnecessary MRP sticker templates, I developed four standard templates that can be used for both single packs and large cartons.
  
- Encountered difficulties integrating the template structure data.
  - **Solution**: Collaborated with the packing department to resolve these issues.

## Conclusion
The development of the MRP sticker web application not only improved our inventory management processes but also provided significant operational benefits to the organization. This project enhanced my skills in web development and reinforced my understanding of creating user-centered applications. I look forward to applying what Iâ€™ve learned to future projects.
